# Missing Semester Window Manager MSWM
Missing Semester Window Manager is an attempt at passing the course "Missing Semester" by implementing a custom window manager in Rust based on x11rb.
The aim is to remain minimalistic in design with a clean implementation of essentials as well as functionalities and extendability according to our personal preferences.

## Usage
TODO: get documentation monkey to generate human readable decription of dependencies & bash script etc.
